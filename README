This is a very simple command line vocabulary trainer, as I like it.

You give one command line argument: the filename of the MLVT dictionary database.

You will get a list of categories.
enter a comma separated list of categories you want to train.

Words will be asked, and you should answer the translation.

If you fail, you can read the correct answer, and you should enter it.

A word is deemed to be learned when you were able to enter it correctly at first try four times.

I have found this trainer very helpful. I have been written its first version in basic on an enterprise-128 (with a casette player as "mass" storage) 23 years ago. It is the 3rd and shortest version.

Now we also have a simple manager, as I could not find the MLVT package within 1 minute :)
